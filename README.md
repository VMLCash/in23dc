**A 10 million document corpus takes 31 GB of RAM as float32. turbovec fits it in 4 GB - and searches it faster than FAISS.**

turbovec is a Rust vector index with Python bindings, built on Google Research's [**TurboQuant**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874) algorithm — a data-oblivious quantizer that matches the Shannon lower bound on distortion, with no codebook training and no separate train phase.

- **Online ingest.** Add vectors, they're indexed — no train step, no parameter tuning, no rebuilds as the corpus grows.
- **Faster than FAISS.** Hand-written NEON (ARM) and AVX-512BW (x86) kernels beat FAISS IndexPQFastScan by 12–20% on ARM and match-or-beat it on x86.
- **Filter at search time.** Pass an id allowlist (or a slot bitmask) to `search()` and the kernel honours it directly. You always get up to `k` results from the allowed set — no over-fetching, no recall hit on selective filters.
- **Pure local.** No managed service, no data leaving your machine or VPC. Pair with any open-source embedding model for a fully air-gapped RAG stack.

Building RAG where privacy, memory, or latency matters? **You're in the right place.**

## Python

```bash
pip install turbovec
```

```python
from turbovec import TurboQuantIndex

index = TurboQuantIndex(dim=1536, bit_width=4)
index.add(vectors)
index.add(more_vectors)

scores, indices = index.search(query, k=10)

index.write("my_index.tq")
loaded = TurboQuantIndex.load("my_index.tq")
```

Need stable ids that survive deletes? Use `IdMapIndex`:

```python
import numpy as np
from turbovec import IdMapIndex

index = IdMapIndex(dim=1536, bit_width=4)
index.add_with_ids(vectors, np.array([1001, 1002, 1003], dtype=np.uint64))

scores, ids = index.search(query, k=10)   # ids are your uint64 external ids
index.remove(1002)                         # O(1) by id

index.write("my_index.tvim")
loaded = IdMapIndex.load("my_index.tvim")
```

### Hybrid retrieval (filtered search)

Restrict results to a candidate set produced by another system (SQL, BM25, ACL, time window, …):

```python
import numpy as np
from turbovec import IdMapIndex

idx = IdMapIndex(dim=1536, bit_width=4)
idx.add_with_ids(vectors, ids)

# Stage 1: external system narrows to candidate ids.
allowed = np.array(db.execute("SELECT id FROM docs WHERE tenant=?", (t,)).fetchall(),
                   dtype=np.uint64)

# Stage 2: dense rerank within the candidate set.
scores, ids = idx.search(query, k=10, allowlist=allowed)
```

Filtering happens inside the SIMD kernel at 32-vector block granularity: blocks with no allowed slots are short-circuited before any LUT lookup or scoring work, and individual non-allowed slots inside scored blocks are dropped at heap-insert. Selective allowlists (small fraction of the index allowed) therefore avoid most of the SIMD cost rather than paying it and discarding the result afterwards.

The output length is `min(k, len(allowed))` — when the allowlist is smaller than `k` you get exactly `len(allowed)` results rather than padded fallbacks.

See [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md) for the full reference.
